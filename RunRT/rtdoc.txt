This file documents input parameters for SBDART, (Santa Barbara DISORT
Atmospheric Radiative Transfer).  SBDART is a software tool that computes
plane-parallel radiative transfer in clear and cloudy conditions within the
Earth's atmosphere and at the surface.  For a general description and review
of the program please refer to Ricchiazzi et al 1998. (Bulletin of the
American Meteorological Society, October 1998).

SBDART's main input file is called INPUT. This file contains a single
NAMELIST input block also named INPUT.  A significant advantage of NAMELIST
input is that not all elements of an input block need be specified by the
user.  Since most of the code inputs have been initialized with reasonable
default values, new users can start by specifying just a few interesting
input parameters.  The default state of input parameters may be determined
by removing INPUT from the current working directory.  When SBDART detects
the absense of file INPUT, it will print the default settings of all input
parameters.  This output may be redirected to a file for editing.

The default configuration of INPUT is as follows:

=======================================================================

NOTE: Unfortunately, many fortran compilers produce rather cryptic error
      messages in response to improper NAMELIST input files.  Here are
      three common NAMELIST error messages and their meaning:

      1. ERROR MESSAGE: invalid reference to variable in NAMELIST input

         MEANING:       you misspelled one of the NAMELIST variable names


      2. ERROR MESSAGE: too many values for NAMELIST variable

         MEANING:       you specified too many values for a variable,
                        most likely because you separated variables by
                        more than one comma.

      2. ERROR MESSAGE: end-of-file during read 
                          or
                        namelist block INPUT not found

         MEANING:       There are two possibilities: 
                        A) you didn't include a NAMELIST block specifier 
                           (INPUT, DINPUT or END) or you misspelled it; or 
                        B) You used the wrong character to signify a 
                           namelist block name.  FORTRAN90 expects the 
                           namelist blocks to start with &<name> and end 
                           with /, but most FORTRAN77 compilers used the
                           $<name>, $END convention.


        
Other input files are sometimes required by SBDART:

atms.dat     -- atmospheric profile          (see input quantity IDATM) 
aerosol.dat  -- aerosol information          (see input quantity IAER)
albedo.dat   -- spectral surface albedo      (see input quantity ISALB)
filter.dat   -- sensor filter function       (see input quantity ISAT)
solar.dat    -- solar spectrum               (see input quantity NF)
usrcld.dat   -- cloud vertical profile       (see input quantity NRE)
cktau.dat    -- high resolution absorption   (see input quantity KDIST)

SBDART usually lists computational results directly to the standard
output device (i.e., the terminal, if run interactively).  However,
some warning messages are written to files named SBDART_WARNING.??
where the question marks indicate a warning message number.  When
running SBDART iteratively over many inputs, the SBDART_WARNING files
will only be created once, on the first iteration that generated the
warning condition. The warning files contain a warning message and a
copy of the input file that triggered the warning.

                    following free format read statements:
                
                         read(13,*,end=100) (wlsun(i),sun(i),i=1,5000)

                    Old versions of SBDART used a different
                    format for spectral input files albedo.dat,
                    filter.dat and solar.dat.  A perl script 'newform'
                    is available from
                    ftp::/ftp.icess.ucsb.edu/pub/esrg/sbdart to
                    convert old data files to the new format.

                   NOTE: If ISAT=-1 a user supplied filter data file
                         "filter.dat" is read from the current working

                         following free format read (numbers may be
                         separated by spaces, commas or carriage returns);

                         The number of wavelength sample points read from 
                         filter.dat should be less than or equal to 1000

                         This file format is new. Previous versions of
                         SBDART used a different format for spectral
                         input files albedo.dat, filter.dat and
                         solar.dat.  A perl script 'newform' is
                         available from 
                         ftp::/ftp.icess.ucsb.edu/pub/esrg/sbdart to
                         convert old data files to the new format.


  WLINF:        lower wavelength limit when ISAT=0    (WLINF > .250 microns)
                central wavelength when ISAT=-2,-3,-4  

  WLSUP:        upper wavelength limit when ISAT=0    (WLSUP < 100.0  microns)
                equivalent width when ISAT=-2,-3,-4

                NOTE: 

                If ISAT eq -2, a rectangular filter (constant with
                wavelength) is used, with central wavelength at WLINF
                and an equivalent width of WLSUP (full width = WLSUP)

                If ISAT eq -3, a triangular filter function is used with
                the central wavelength at WLINF and an equivalent width of
                WLSUP (full width = 2*WLSUP) (filter function is zero at end
                points, and one at WLINF).

                If ISAT eq -4, a gaussian filter function is used with
                the central wavelength at WLINF and an equivalent width of
                WLSUP (full width = 4*WLSUP) 

                If output is desired at a single wavelength, set
                WLINF=WLSUP and ISAT=0.  In this case, SBDART will 
                set WLINC=1 (the user specified value of WLINC is ignored)
                and the output will be in units of (W/m2/um) for
                irradiance and (W/m2/um/sr) for radiance.  


  WLINC:        This parameter specifies the spectral resolution of the 
                SBDART run.  Though the spectral limits of the calculation
                are always input in terms of wavelength, the spectral
                step size can be specified in terms of constant
                increments of wavelength, log(wavelength) [same as
                constant increment of log(wavenumber)] or wavenumber.
                Which one to choose depends on where in the spectral
                bandpass you want to place the most resolution.
                
                Since SBDART is based on LOWTRAN7 band models, which
                have a spectral resolution of 20 cm-1, it would be extreme
                overkill to allow spectral step size less than 1 cm-1. On
                the other hand a spectral resolution coarser than 1 um
                is also pretty useless. Therefore the way WLINC is 
                interpreted depends on whether it is less than zero,
                between zero and one, or greater than 1.
                
              * WLINC = 0 (the default) =>  wavelength increment is
                equal to 0.005 um or 1/10 the wavelength range, which
                ever is smaller.  If the WLINF=WLSUP then WLINC=.001
               
              * WLINC < 0 => wavelength increment is a constant fraction
                of the current wavelength.  WLINC is interpreted as
                a specified value of delta(lambda)/lambda and the 
                wavelength steps are adjusted so that wavelength step is
                approximately the product of the current wavelength and 
                WLINC.

                Specifying the wavelength increment as a fractional
                step size is useful when the wavelength range extends
                over more than an decade of wavelength.  For example,
                if the wavelength range is 0.5 to 20.0, specifying a
                constant wavelength increment of .01 microns tends to
                under-resolve the low wavelengths and over-resolve the
                long wavelengths.  Setting WLINC = -.01 causes the
                code to use a wavelength increment of about .005
                microns in the visible and about .2 micron in the
                thermal infrared, which is a better compromise of
                resolution and computer time.  
                

              * 1 >= WLINC > 0    => WLINC is the wavelength step size (um)

                if WLINC > 1 then WLINC is the step size in inverse
                centimeters.  If maximum fidelity is required and 
                gaseous absorption is the primary influence on the 
                output, then WLINC should be set to 20, which is the 
                wavenumber resolution of the LOWTRAN7 band models.

                The total number of wavelength steps, nwl, is given by

                 nwl = 1+ln(wlsup/wlinf)/|wlinc|          wlinc < 0
            
                 nwl = 1+(wlsup-wlinf)/wlinc             1 >= wlinc > 0

                ==============

  SZA:          solar zenith angle (degrees) (default = 0.) 
                Solar input may be turned off by setting sza>90
                SZA is ignored if CSZA is non-negative or IDAY is non-zero.

  CSZA:         Cosine of solar zenith angle.  If CSZA > 0, solar
                zenith angle is set to acos(CSZA) (default = -1.)

  SAZA:         solar azimuth angle (degrees) (default = 0.)
                SAZA is ignored if IDAY is non-zero.  Setting SAZA=180.
                will cause the forward scattering peak to appear near
                phi=0 (see below).

  IDAY:         If IDAY > 0, the solar illumination angles (SZA, SAZA)  
                are computed from the specified time and geographic
                coordinates using an internal solar ephemeris
                algorithm (see subroutine zensun). IDAY is the number
                of days into a standard "year", with IDAY=1 and the
                1st of January and IDAY=365 on the 31st of December
                if IDAY > 365, IDAY is replaced internally by 
                mod(IDAY-1,365)+1.

                If IDAY < 0, the code writes the values of abs(iday),time,
                alat,alon,sza,azm, and solfac to standard output and exits.

  TIME:         UTC time (Grenwich) in decimal hours
  ALAT:         latitude of point on earth's surface
  ALON:         east longitude of point on earth's surface
  
                NOTE: TIME, ALAT and ALON are ignored if IDAY .eq. 0

  SOLFAC:       solar distance factor.  Use this factor to account
                for seasonal variations of the earth-sun distance.
                If R is the earth-sun distance in Astronomical Units
                then SOLFAC=1./R**2.  SOLFAC is set internally when the
                solar geometry is set through IDAY, TIME, ALAT and ALON.
                In this case SOLFAC is set to,
                                                             -2 
                SOLFAC = ( 1.-eps*cos(2*pi*(IDAY-perh)/365) )

                where eps  = orbital eccentricity = 0.01673
                and   perh = day of perihelion    = 2           (jan 2)

                NOTE: seasonal variations in earth-sun distance
                      produce a +/-3.4% perturbation in the TOA solar
                      flux.  This factor should be included when
                      making detailed comparisons to surface
                      measurements.

  NOSCT:        aerosol scattering mode used for boundary layer aerosols:
                0    normal scattering and absorption treatment
                1    reduce optical depth by (1-ssa*asym), set ssa=0
                2    set ssa=0
                3    reduce optical depth by (1-ssa), set ssa=0
                
                where ssa=single scattering albedo, and asym=asymmetry factor

                nosct does not affect the stratospheric aerosol models or
                the iaer=5 boundary layer model.


                 SURFACE REFLECTANCE PROPERTIES
                 ==============================

  ISALB:         SURFACE ALBEDO FEATURE

                -1 -spectral surface albedo read from "albedo.dat"
                 0 -user specified, spectrally uniform albedo set with ALBCON

                 1 -snow              
                 2 -clear water       
                 3 -lake water         
                 4 -sea  water
                 5 -sand           (data range 0.4 - 2.3um)
                 6 -vegetation     (data range 0.4 - 2.6um)

                 7 -ocean water brdf, includes bio-pigments, foam, and sunglint
                    additional input parameters provided in SC.

                 8 -Hapke analytic brdf model. additional input parameters
                    provided in SC. 

                 9 -Ross-thick Li-sparse brdf model. additional input
                    parameters in SC.

                NOTE: isalb = 7, 8, 9 causes sbdart to use a non-Lambertian
                      surface reflectance. Since the reflectance BRDF
                      must first be expanded in terms of orthogonal
                      functions, this mode of operation is somewhat
                      more time consuming than the normal Lambertian
                      reflectance models, In some cases flux
                      calculations may be accurately computed in
                      Lambertian mode by using directional albedo
                      computed from the brdf, assuming all the
                      incomming radiation is along the solar beam
                      direction.  Of course this approach will
                      probably fail in cases where the solar direct
                      beam doesn't dominate the downwelling radiation
                      (e.g., in the infrared or under clouds).  SBDART
                      may be run with directional albedos by setting
                      isalb to -7, -8 or -9.

                10 -combination of snow, seawater, sand and vegetation
                    partition factors set by input quantity SC

                NOTE: If ISALB=-1 a user supplied spectral reflectance
                      file "albedo.dat" is read from the current working
                      directory. This ASCII file is read with the
                      following free format read (numbers may be
                      separated by spaces, commas or carriage returns);

                         read(13,*,end=100) (wlalb(i),alb(i),i=1,huge(0))
                     100 continue

                         where, wlalb   wavelength sample points (microns)
                                alb     spectral albedo (unitless)
                                
                         The number of wavelength sample points read from 
                         albedo.dat should be less than or equal to 1000

                      
                The user specified reflectance may cover any
                wavelength range and have arbitrarily high resolution.
                This contrasts with the standard reflectance models
                (sand, vegetation, lake water and sea water) which are
                only specified in in the range .25 to 4 um at 5nm
                resolution.  

                Prior to version 2.0, SBDART used a different format
                for spectral input files albedo.dat, filter.dat and
                solar.dat.  A perl script 'newform' is available from
                ftp::/ftp.icess.ucsb.edu/pub/esrg/sbdart to convert
                old data files to the new format.

                NOTE: A large collection of spectral reflectance
                data is available from the JPL Spectral library:

                           http://speclib.jpl.nasa.gov/ 


                The jpl spectral files may be used by sbdart after
                processing with this one line perl command:

  perl -lane 'print "$F[0] ",$F[1]/100 if /^ *[0-9]/' < jplfile > albedo.dat
           
                where jplfile is the name of the spectral library file.



  ALBCON:       ISALB=0 --  a spectrally uniform, surface albedo 

  SC:           surface albedo specification parameters used for
                isalb=7, 8 and 10


                ---------- isalb=7 ----------

                SC specifies ocean reflection model parameters:

         SC(1): Oceanic pigment concentration in mg/m3.
                Pigment is assumed to consist of Chlorophyll a + 
                Pheophytin a.  Pigment concentration affects the ocean 
                brdf in the wavelength range from 0.4-0.7um (Default = 0.01)
                Turn off the subsurface contribution by setting SC(1)=0
                (Note that subsurface contribution is set to a non-zero
                constant for 0 < pigment_concentration < 0.0001.  I.e.,
                the subsurface contribution does not approach zero 
                continuously as sc(1) goes to zero.)


         SC(2): Wind speed over ocean in m/s. Wind speed affects the 
                sunglint and foam contributions to the ocean brdf 
                (Default=5 m/s)

         SC(3): Oceanic salinity in parts per thousand.  Salinity affects 
                the Fresnel reflectivity of the ocean surface (Default=34.3)

                NOTE: The oceanic brdf model is nearly the same as the
                one used in the 6s radiative transfer model.  The only
                difference is that the brdf in SBDART does not depend
                on the wind direction.   The brdf dependence on wind
                direction was eliminated by averaging the 6s reflectance
                model over 360 degrees of wind azimuth.
                
                Note: The 6s model does not include any provisions for
                wave facet shading, so results for shallow
                illumination or viewing directions may be incorrect.
                Additional information is available from "Second
                Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar
                Spectrum (6S), user's guide" by Vermote, E., D. Tanre,
                J.L. Deuze, M. Herman, and J.J. Morcrette (1995).


                ---------- isalb=8 ----------

                SC specifies Hapke analytic brdf model parameters:

         SC(1): Single scattering albedo of surface particles
         SC(2): Asymmetry factor of scattering by surface particles
         SC(3): Magnitude of hot spot (opposition effect)
         SC(4): Width of hot spot

         NOTE:  This model is based on Hapke, 1981

                also see P. Pinet, A. Cord, S. Chevrel and Y. Daydou, 
                (2003): 'Experimental determination of the Hapke parameters 
                for planetary regolith surface analogs'

                Generic vegetation (actually clover), may be described
                with sc=0.101,-0.263, 0.589, 0.046. 
                (From Pinty and Verstraete, 1991).
             
                Snow may be described with
                sc=0.99, 0.6, 0.0, 0.995. 
                (From Domingue et al., 1997; and Verbiscer and Veverka, 1990).


                ---------- isalb=9 ----------

                SC specifies the Ross-thick Li-sparse brdf model parameters

                SC(1)=isotropic coefficient
                SC(2)=volumetric coefficient
                SC(3)=geometric shadowing coefficient
                SC(4)=hot spot magnitude
                SC(5)=hot spot width

                (Ross, 1981; Li and Strahler, 1992).

                ---------- isalb=10 ----------

                SC specifies mixing ratios snow, ocean, sand and vegetation

                Composite albedo fractions (applies only when ISALB=10)
         SC(1): fraction of snow         
         SC(2): fraction of ocean        
         SC(3): fraction of sand         
         SC(4): fraction of vegetation   

        NOTE:   SC(1)+SC(2)+SC(3)+SC(4) need not sum to 1.
                Thus, it is possible to use the SC factor to
                boost the overall reflectance of a given
                surface type.  For example, SC=0,0,2,0 yields
                results for a surface with spectral reflectivity
                twice that of sand.  Beware, total reflectance 
                greater than one will produce unphysical results.

                directory.  This ASCII file is read with the following
                free format read statements (input values may be

                10   continue

                     where nn is the number atmospheric layers 
                              nn should be less or equal to than MXLY, 
                              a parameter used in SBDART (see params.f)
                              to set the maximum number of levels in the 
                              vertical grids.

                           z  is the layer altitude in km 
                              (z must be monotonically decreasing)
                           p  is the pressure in millibars
                           t  is the temperature is Kelvin

                If IDATM is set to a negative number in the range -1
                to -6 SBDART prints the atmospheric model
                corresponding to abs(idatm) to standard out, and then
                quits.  The output atmospheric profile will reflect 
                any modifications caused by input parameters 
                UW, UO3, O3TRP, PBAR, ZPRES, RHCLD, and KRHCLR.

  AMIX:         weighting factor,  when positive this factor controls
                how much of the atms.dat atmospheric profile to mix in
                with one of the standard internal profiles selected by
                IDATM.  For example IDATM=1 and AMIX=.7 specifies a
                70% weighting of atms.dat and a 30% weighting of
                profile TROPIC.  No (default=-1)

 
  UW:           integrated water vapor amount (G/CM2)

  UO3:          integrated ozone concentration (ATM-CM) 
                above the level ZTRP.  The default value of ZTRP=0,
                so UO3 usally specifies the total ozone column.
                If UO3 is negative the original ozone density is used. 
                (default=-1) 

          NOTE: 1 atm-cm = 1000 Dobson Units

          NOTE: Use UW or UO3 to set the integrated amounts of water
                vapor or ozone in the model atmosphere.  Aside from
                multiplicative factors the vertical profile will be
                that of the original model atmosphere set by IDATM.
                The original unmodified density profile is used when
                UW or UO3 is negative.

  O3TRP:        integrated ozone concentration (ATM-CM) in troposphere.
 		i.e., for z.lt.ZTRP.  The original tropospheric density
                (set with IDATM) is used when O3TRP is negative. 
                (default=-1.)
 
  ZTRP:         The altitude of the tropopause.  The parameters UO3 and
 		O3TRP sets the total column ozone in the stratosphere
 		and troposphere, respectively.  Note: since the default
 		value of ZTRP is zero, UO3 normally sets the integrated 
                ozone amount of the entire atmosphere (default=0).

  XSO2:         volume mixing ratio of SO2  (PPM,  default =      3.0e-4)
  XNO:          volume mixing ratio of NO   (PPM,  default =      3.0e-4)
  XHNO3:        volume mixing ratio of HNO3 (PPM,  default =      5.0e-5)
  XNO2:         volume mixing ratio of NO2  (PPM,  default =      2.3e-5)

                NOTE: Setting any of these factors to -1 causes that 
                      atmospheric component to retain its nominal 
                      mixing ratio defined in the US62 atmosphere 
                      (as listed above).
                      
                      The volume mixing ratio (VMR) of a given species
                      is adjusted by specifying the surface value of
                      its VMR in PPM.  The entire altitude profile is
                      multiplied by the ratio of the user specified
                      VMR and the nominal surface VMR.  

                      There are no further re-normalizations of the
                      VMR.  Thus, the total of all the VMRs may be
                      greater or less than 10^6. By the way, the
                      default set of VMRs do not add up to 10^6
                      because of the exclusion of the noble gases
                      which do not have any radiative effects.
                      
  XRSC:         sensitivity factor for Rayleigh scattering (default=1)
                This factor varies the strength of Rayleigh scattering
                for sensitivity studies.

  XO4:          sensitivity factor to adjust strength of absorption by
                oxygen collisional complexes (default=1, see comments
                in subroutine o4cont)

  PBAR:         surface pressure in millibars. 

                PBAR > 0 causes each pressure to be multiplied by the
                factor (PBAR/P0) where P0 is the surface pressure of the
                original atmosphere. The absorption due to mixed gases
                is affected, but absorption by ozone and water vapor is not
                (they are separately controlled by UW and UO3).  The 
                Rayleigh scattering optical depth is proportional to the
                PBAR/P0 factor.  

                PBAR = 0 disables Rayleigh scattering and all atmospheric 
                absorption (including water vapor and ozone). Scattering 
                by aerosols or clouds is not affected.

                PBAR <  0, causes the original pressure profile to be used.
                (this is the default)

                NOTE: PBAR has no effect of the CKTAU optical depths.

                

  ZPRES:        Surface altitude in kilometers. 
                This parameter is just an alternate way of setting the
                surface pressure, and should not be set when PBAR is
                specified.  When ZPRES is set PBAR is obtained by
                logarithmic interpolation on the current model's
                atmosphere pressure and altitude arrays. Changing
                ZPRES does not alter other parameters in the
                atmospheric model in any way.  Note that setting a
                large value of ZPRES may push the tropopause (where
                dT/dz=0) to an unrealistically high altitude.

  SCLH2O:       Water vapor scale height in km. 

                If SCLH2O .gt. 0, then water vapor is vertically
                distributed as exp(-z/SCLH2O)

                If SCLH2O .le. 0, then the original vertical profile
                is used. Changing SCLH2O has no effect on the total
                water vapor amount.


                CLOUD PARAMETERS
                ================

  ZCLOUD:       Altitude of cloud layers (km) (up to 5 values), Cloud
                layers may be specified in two ways. To specify separate 
                cloud layers, set ZCLOUD to a sequence of monotonically 
                increasing altitudes.  A cloud layer with optical depth 
                TCLOUD(j) will start at the highest computation level
                for which z(i).le.ZCLOUD(j)+.001  and will extend to the
                next higher level, z(i+1). 

                To specify a range of altitudes which will be filled
                by cloud, tag the second element of the range with a
                minus sign.  In this case the element of TCLOUD that 
                corresponds to the negative element of ZCLOUD specifies
                the gradient of the optical depth.  Setting this element
                of TCLOUD to 1 causes a uniform opacity between the 
                lower and upper limits of the cloud layer. See description
                of TCLOUD input.  Consider,

                zcloud=1,-3,10,-15
                tcloud=4, 1, 8,  1
                nre   =6, 6, 10,  20
                
                In this example two continuous cloud layers are
                defined, the lower one extends from 1 to 3 km and has
                a total optical depth of 4 and an effective radius of
                6um.  The upper cloud layer extends from 10 to 15 km,
                has a total optical thickness of 8 and a sliding value
                of effective radius which starts 10um at the bottom of
                the cloud and ramps up to 20um at 15km  The ramping 
                function is logarithmic, i.e., 
                    nre(12km)=10*(20/10)**((12-10)/15-10)).
                Note that the actual location of the cloud layers is
                determined by the resolution and placement of vertical
                grid points in SBDART, as explained below.

                SBDART puts the i'th cloud layer at the highest vertical
                grid point, k, such that
                
                   z(k) .le. abs(ZCLOUD(i)+.001)

                NOTE: A cloud with a nominal altitude equal to that of
                one of the computational layer altitudes, Z(K),
                actually extends from Z(k) to the next higher grid
                point.  For example, a cloud layer at Z(k) will not
                affect the direct beam flux at Z(k+1) (one layer
                above) but will strongly affect it at Z(k).  (You can
                check this out your self by setting IOUT=10 and
                ZCLOUD=1 and messing around with ZOUT to get outputs
                just above or below the cloud).
                
                Suppose the bottom of your computational grid looks like

                 k         z(k)
                 ...       ...
                 6         2.5
                 5         2.0
                 4         1.5
                 3         1.0
                 2         0.5
                 1         0.0

                Consider this input,

                         ZCLOUD=1.0, -6.0,  4.0, -9.0
                         TCLOUD=50.,  1.0, 10.,  1.0
                         NRE   = 8.,    8, 20.,  20.

                Here two overlapping cloud decks are specified, one
                extending from 1 to 6 km with a total optical
                thickness of 50, and the other from 4 to 9 km with a
                total thickness of 10.  Since the total cloud optical
                thickness is spread over the total altitude range we
                would have 10 optical depths per km for the lower cloud
                deck and 2 optical depths per km for the second.  The
                code adds the effects of both cloud decks in the
                region of overlap.  Scattering parameters (e.g., single 
                scattering albedo) in the overlap region are given by 
                the weighted averages of the values computed from the mie
                scattering database using effective radius appropriate to
                each cloud deck, and weighting according to the opacity 
                contributed by each cloud deck.

                If you have any doubt about where the code is putting
                the cloud, set IDB(5)=1 (see below) to get a diagnostic 
                print out of cloud optical depth.
                 
                NOTE: do not try to put an ice cloud (NRE < 0) in a
                      cloud layer range which includes water cloud 
                      (2 le NRE le 128).  In other words this specification
                      won't work:

                        ZCLOUD = 1,-4
                        TCLOUD = 1, 1
                        NRE    = 8,-1

  TCLOUD:       Optical thickness of cloud layer, (up to 5 values)

                TCLOUD specifies the cloud optical depth at a
                wavelength of 0.55um.    The cloud optical depth at
                other wavelengths is computed using the relation,

                tau = TCLOUD*Q(wl)/Q(0.55um),

                where Q is the extinction efficiency, which is a
                function of effective radius and wavelength (see
                discussion of LWP for a definition of Q).  The code
                contains a look-up table of Q that covers effective
                radii in the range 2 to 128um for water clouds and for
                a single effective radius of 106um for ice clouds.
                The wavelengths range is 0.29 to 333.33 um for water
                clouds and .29 to 20 um for ice clouds.

                When specifying an optical depth for a range of grid
                levels, the second TCLOUD entry corresponding to the
                cloud top altitude is usually set to one.  This
                produces a uniform distribution of opacity over the
                altitude range.    

                For example,

                ZCLOUD= 1 ,-5,0,0,0    # uniformly distributed opacity
                TCLOUD= 10, 1,0,0,0    # for a cloud of extent 4 km
                NRE=    10,20          # 2.5 optical depths per km
                                       # effective radius ramps from 
                                       # 10 to 20 between 1 and 5km
 
                A linearly varying opacity distribution can be
                obtained by setting the second TCLOUD entry to a
                factor which represents the ratio of the opacity in
                the highest layer to that in the lowest layer
 
                For example,
 
                ZCLOUD= 1 ,-5,0,0,0    # linearly distributed opacity
                TCLOUD= 10, 4,0,0,0    # for a cloud of extent 4 km
                                       # between tau(1-2km)=1
                                       # between tau(2-3km)=2
                                       # between tau(3-4km)=3
                                       # between tau(4-5km)=4
                                       #
                                       # tau(total)=10
                                       # tau(4-5km)/tau(1-2km)=4
 
                NOTE: if r is the ratio of the top to bottom and t 
                      is the average opacity per level then,
 
                           tau(top_level)=t*2r/(1+r)
 
                           tau(bot_level)=t*2/(1+r)
 
                NOTE: a linear increase in opacity, starting from zero
                      at the cloud bottom, is obtained by setting, 
 
                           r=1 + 2*zdiff/dz
 
                      where dz is the grid spacing and zdiff is the total
                      altitude range over which the cloud extends.  This
                      formula assumes constant grid spacing over the 
                      cloud altitude range.  Thus, if dz=1 then 
                      ZCLOUD= 1,-5  and TCLOUD= 10,7  yeilds a linear 
                      increase from zero.
 

  NRE:          Cloud drop effective radius (microns).    (up to 5 values)
                Default value of NRE=8.  

                The absolute value of NRE should be a floating point
                number in the range 2.0 to 128.0.  
                NRE < 0 selects mie scattering parameters for ice particles
                NRE > 0 selects mie scattering parameters for water droplets

                The drop size distribution is assumed to follow a 
                gamma distribution:

                                 (p-1)  (-r/Ro) 
                N(r) = C * (r/Ro)      e
 
                where C is a normalization constant [C=1./(Ro*gamma(p))], 
                p=7, and Ro=NRE/(p+2)

                The factor (p+2) relating Ro to NRE follows
                from the defining equation of NRE:

                         3             2
                NRE = < r  N(r) > / < r  N(r) >, 

                where the angle brackets indicate integration over all
                drop radii.

                Another frequently used parameter to describe the size
                distribution is the mode radius, Rm, which is defined
                as the radius at which N(r) is maximized.  For our
                drop size distribution Rm=(p-1)*Ro.  Using the relation 
                between Ro and NRE we find that, Rm=(p-1)*NRE/(p+2)

                NOTE: If the first element of NRE is zero, the
                values of TCLOUD, ZCLOUD, LWP and NRE are ignored and 
                cloud specification records are read from file usrcld.dat.
                The first record in this file corresponds to the
                lowest layer in the atmosphere, that is between the
                surface and the lowest cell boundary altitude. Each
                following record sets values for the next higher
                atmospheric layer in the model atmosphere.  usrcld.dat
                is read with the following fortran statements:

                          then scattering parameters are obtained

                          covering ice spheres with effective radii

                          is non-zero.  if fwp.lt.0 and rei.le.0 
                          then effective radius of ice is taken 
                          from ccm3 cirrus model (see subroutine 
                          icepar) (default=-1)
                 
                 cldfrac  cloud fraction in layer. this parameter
                          reduces cloud optical depth by factor
                          cldfrac**1.5 (default=1)
 
                It is not necessary to provide input records for
                layers above the highest cloud.  In addition, a
                forward slash terminates interpretation of data values
                in a record.  For example, the following records in
                usrcld.dat specify a cloud that extends from 2 to 4 km
                (assuming idatm>0 and no regridding):

                /                 # no cloud between 0-1 km
                /                 # no cloud between 1-2 km
                30 /              # lwp=30, re=10 between 2-3 km
                60 20 5 30 .2 /   # lwp=60, re=20 fwp=5 reice=30 cldfrac=.2
                                  #        between 3-4 km
                
                Any input quantities that are left unspecified will
                retain their default values of lwp=0. reff=8,
                fwp=0, reice=-1, and cldfrac=1.  The radiative
                properties of ice are computed from a CCM3 model (see
                subroutine ICEPAR).
              

  IMOMC:        Controls the phase function model used in cloud layers:
                1  isotropic scattering
                2  rayleigh scattering phase function
                3  henyey_greenstein [a function of asymmetry factor, g(re)]
                4  haze L as specified by garcia/siewert
                5  cloud c.1 as specified by garcia/siewert

                (default=3)

  LWP:          The liquid water path (or frozen water path if nre.le.0)
                of a cloud is specified in units of g/m2.  This is another 
                way to specify cloud optical depth.

                A linearly varying opacity distribution can be
                obtained by setting the second LWP entry to a
                factor which represents the ratio of the opacity in
                the highest layer to that in the lowest layer
                For more details see the discussion of TCLOUD.

                NOTE: a 1 mm column of liquid water = 1000 g/m2, 

                NOTE: LWP and TCLOUD cannot be used at the same time

                NOTE: The cloud optical depth is related to LWP by

                             3 Q(wl) * LWP
                      tau =  -------------
                             4  RHO * NRE  

                      where Q is the scattering efficiency and RHO is
                      the density of liquid water (1 g/cm3).  The
                      value of Q that applies to a distribution of
                      cloud droplets can be expressed in terms of the
                      extinction cross-section at a given wavelength and
                      liquid drop radius.

                                                             
                      Let      sigma = extinction cross-section at a given
                                       wavelength and drop radius 

                                   q = sigma/(pi*r^2) (dimensionless)

                                       where (pi*r^2) is the geometrical
                                       cross-section of the cloud drop

                      then Q is a weighted average over drop radius,
                      given by:

                             2              2
                      Q = < r q N(r) > / < r  N(r) >

                      for visible light Q is typically about 2
                      (dimensionless).  

                      For example: 
                      NRE = 10um and LWP= 200g/m2 = 0.2mm =>   tau = 30


  RHCLD:        The relative humidity within a cloud layer (a floating point
                value between 0.0 and 1.0).  RHCLD<0 disables the adjustment
                of relative humidity, in which case the relative humidity in
                the cloud layer is unchanged (it varies with the temperature 
                and water vapor density of the initial model atmosphere).  
                This parameter has no effect when KDIST<0

  KRHCLR:       If zero, water vapor mixing ratio in clear layers is 
                proportionately reduced to maintain the water vapor
                path specified by WH. This option has no effect if
                RHCLD is negative or TCLOUD is zero. if KRHCLR=1, the 
                relative humidity in clear layers is unchanged. (default=0)
                
                NOTE: if KRHCLR=1 and clouds are present, the actual
                water vapor path will differ from that specified by WH.
                On the other hand, if KRHCLR=0, the normalization procedure
                may drive the water vapor in clear layers to zero and still
                be unable produce a given WVP.  This parameter has no 
                effect when KDIST<0



                STRATOSPHERIC AEROSOLS (LOWTRAN 7 model)
                =========================================

  JAER:         5 element array of stratospheric aerosol types  

                0-no aerosol
                1-background stratospheric
                2-aged volcanic
                3-fresh volcanic
                4-meteor dust

  ZAER:         altitudes (above the surface) of stratospheric aerosol 
                layers (km) Up to 5 layer altitudes may be specified.
                NOTE: even though these models are for stratospheric
                aerosols, the scattering layer may be placed anywhere
                within the numerical grid. See ZCLOUD for a discussion
                of how aerosol (cloud) layers are positioned within
                SBDART's computational grid.

  TAERST:       optical depth (at 0.55 microns) of each stratospheric
                aerosol layer.  Up to 5 layer optical depths may be
                specified.


                BOUNDARY LAYER AEROSOLS (BLA)
                =============================

  IAER:         Boundary layer aerosol type selector

               -1-read aerosol optical depth and scattering parameters
                  from aerosol.dat. See subroutine AEREAD. 
                
                  the file format is readable by the following Fortran code:

                  read(11,*) nn, moma
                  do k=1,huge(0)
                    read(11,*,end=100) wl(k)
                    do i=nz-nn+1,nz
                      read(11,*) dtau(i,k),waer(i,k),pmom(1:moma,i,k)
                    enddo
                  enddo
              100 continue

                  where 
                    nn          is the number of atmospheric levels for
                                which aerosol information is specified.

                    moma        number of phase function moments

                    wl(k)       is the wavelength [ wl(k) < wl(k+1) ]

                    dtau(i,k)   is the optical depth increment within
                                level i at wavelength k, information is
                                specified in top-down order. 

                    waer(i,k)   is the single scattering albedo

                    pmom(m,i,k) are legendre moments of the phase function.
                                Note that zeroeth moment is not read, it
                                is assumed to be 1.

                     NOTE:      Layers are read from top to bottom
                                starting from layer nz-nn+1, i.e., the
                                lowest nn levels in the atmosphere.  A single
                                forward slash may be used to indicate levels
                                with zero aerosol optical depth.



                0-no boundary layer aerosols (all BLA parameters ignored)

                1-rural       

                2-urban       

                3-oceanic     

                4-tropospheric

                5-user defined spectral dependence of BLA 
 
                  The wavelength dependence of the aerosol scattering
                  parameters are replaced by those read in from input
                  parameters wlbaer, tbaer, wbaer and gbaer.  Between 
                  1 and 47 spectral values may be specified.
 
                NOTE: the spectral dependence of the boundary layer aerosol
                      models (IAER=1,2,3,4) vary with relative humidity.
                      See subroutine AEROSOL for details.

                NOTE: Don't be mislead by the term "boundary layer
                      aerosol". The BLA models, IAER=1,2,3,4
                      were originally developed to describe aerosols
                      in the lower atmosphere.  However in SBDART, the
                      default vertical density of BLA falls off
                      exponentially, and affects regions above the
                      normal extent of the boundary layer.  The
                      vertical influence of these aerosols may be
                      confined to a specified boundary layer altitude
                      with the optional parameters ZBAER and DBAER.

  RHAER:        The spectral dependence of the boundary layer aerosol
                scattering parameters are sensitive to relative humidity.
                Use input parameter RHAER to set the relative humidity
                used in the boundary layer aerosol model. Set RHAER=-1 
                (the default value) to use the ambient surface relative 
                humidity computed from the temperature and water vapor 
                density of the current model atmosphere.  RHAER has no 
                effect when IAER = 5.

  VIS:          (Horizontal Path) Visibility (km) at 0.55 microns
                due to boundary layer aerosols.  This parameter does
                not set the optical depth for the user defined aerosol
                model (IAER=5), but does affect that model through
                the vertical structure (see below).
                

                NOTE: unlike the stratospheric aerosols, the boundary
                      layer aerosols have predefined vertical density
                      distributions.  These vertical structure models
                      vary with visibility.  (see discussion of ZBAER
                      and DBAER)

                NOTE: The boundary layer aerosol optical depth 
                      (absorption + scattering) at 0.55 microns 
                      is given by

                      tauaero(0.55um) = 3.912 * integral ( n(z)/n(0) dz) / VIS

                      where n(z) is the vertical profile of aerosol
                      density.  For the 5 and 23 km visibility models
                      the indicated integral is 1.05 and 1.51 km,
                      respectively. So,

                      tauaero(0.55um) = 3.912*(1.05*w+1.51*(1-w))/vis

                      where w is a weighting factor between the two
                      extremes and is given by 

                           (1/vis-1/23)
                       w = ----------       ,    5 < vis < 23
                           (1/5-1/23)


                       w = 1                ,    vis < 5

                       w = 0                ,    vis > 23

                NOTE: Visibility is defined as the horizontal distance
                      in km at which a beam of light at 0.55um is
                      attenuated by a factor of 0.02.

                      n(0)*sigma*VIS = -ln(.02), or

                      VIS = 3.912/(n(0)*sigma)

                      where sigma is the aerosol absorption+scattering
                      cross-section at 0.55 microns.  See Glossary of
                      Meteorology, American Meteorology Society, 1959

  ZBAER:        Altitude grid for custom aerosol vertical profile (km)
                Up to MXLY altitude points may be specified.  ZBAER is
                active for all positive values of IAER.

  DBAER:        Aerosol density at ZBAER altitude grid points, active for
                all positive values of IAER.  Up to MXLY density values
                may be specified. The number of density values must
                match the number of ZBAER.  The units used to specify
                aerosol density is arbitrary, since the overall
                profile is scaled by the user specified total vertical
                optical depth.  The aerosol density at all
                computational grid points is found through logarithmic
                interpolation on the ZBAER and DBAER values.  The
                normal vertical profile from 5s is used when DBAER is
                unset.
                
                For example 
                   
                   ZBAER=0,1,100
                   DBAER=1000,500,1

                specifies a aerosol density profile that drops by a 
                factor 2 (exponential fall off) between 0 and 1km altitude
                and then by a factor of 500 between 1 and 100 km.

                If DBAER is set but ZBAER is not set, then the elements
                of DBAER are used to set the aerosol density for each 
                computational layer, starting from the bottom layer.

                For example,

                   DBAER=10,0,1,0

                puts aerosol in the first and third layer.

                If neither ZBAER or DBAER are set, the boundary layer
                aerosols are assumed to follow a pre-defined vertical
                distribution which drops off exponentially with a
                scale height between 1.05 and 1.51 km depending
                visibility (see VIS).  Thus, even if visibility is not
                used to set the vertical optical depth it can affect
                the result through the vertical profile. Note that
                ZBAER and DBAER do not affect the total vertical
                optical depth of aerosols. (See discussion for VIS).

  TBAER:        Vertical optical depth of boundary layer aerosols nominally 
                at 0.55 um. TBAER input is significant for all values of IAER. 
                When IAER=1,2,3,4 the specified value of TBAER
                supersedes the aerosol optical depth derived from
                input parameter VIS (but VIS still controls vertical
                structure model unless DBAER and ZBAER are set).

  QBAER:        QBAER is the extinction efficiency.  QBAER is only active 
                when IAER=5.  When TBAER is set, QBAER sets the spectral
                dependence of the extinction optical depth as,

                   tau= tbaer * Qext(wave_length)/Qext(0.55)

                where Qext(wave_length) = QBAER interpolated to wave_length
                and wl_reference is 0.55 um unless modified by WLBAER
                
                If TBAER is not set, then the values of QBAER are interpreted
                as extinction optical depths at each wavelength WLBAER.
                
                For example, the Multi Filter Rotating Shadowband
                Radiometer (MFRSR) installed at the Southern Great
                Plains ARM site is able to retrieve aerosol optical
                depth in 6 SW spectral channels.  This information may
                be supplied to SBDART by setting,

                  wlbaer= .414,  .499,  .609,  .665,  .860,  .938
                  qbaer= 0.109, 0.083, 0.062, 0.053, 0.044, 0.041
                  wbaer=6*.9
                  gbaer=6*0.8

                This spectral information is iterpolated or extrapolated to
                all wavelengths using logarithmic fitting on QBAER and
                linear fitting on WBAER and GBAER.  Many aerosol types
                display a power law dependence of extinction efficiency on
                wavelength. The logarithmic interpolation/extrapolation on
                QBAER will reproduce this behavior if it exists in the
                input data.  QBAER need not be specified when aerosol 
                information is provided at a single wavelength.


  WLBAER:       Wavelengths points (um) for user defined aerosol spectral 
                dependence.  Only used when IAER=5. WLBAER (and QBAER) need 
                not be specified if a single spectral point is set.  In this
                case the aerosol optical depth is extrapolated to other 
                wavelengths using a power law (see ABAER).  If only one
                value of WLBAER is set (and IAER=5), that value is used 
                as the reference wavelength at which the value TBAER,
                WBAER, and GBAER or PMAER applies. If WLBAER is not set 
                then the reference wavelength defaults to 0.55um

  WBAER:        Single scattering albedo used with IAER=5.

                WBAER represents the single scattering albedo of
                boundary layer aerosols at wavelengths WLBAER.  

  GBAER:        Asymmetry factor used with IAER=5

                GBAER represents the asymmetry factor of boundary
                layer aerosols at wavelengths WLBAER.  Number of
                values must match the number of WLBAER.                

                GBAER is ignored when parameter PMAER is set or when
                IMOMA .ne. 3


  PMAER:        Legendre moments of the scattering phase function of 
                boundary layer aerosols, only active for IAER=5.  The
                Legendre moments of the phase function are defined as
                the following integral over the scattering phase
                function, f:
  
  
                               /                      /  /
                    pmaer(i) = | f(mu) P(i,mu) d mu  /   | f(mu) d mu
                               /                    /    /
  
                where P(i,mu) is the Legendre polynomial, mu is the cosine
                of the scattering angle, and the range of the integrals are
                from -1 to 1.  The Legendre moment for i=0 is always
                one.  Hence, the zero'th moment is assumed by SBDART and
                should not be specified.
                 
                Unlike the previous boundary layer aerosol parameters, you
                need to specify at least NSTR values for each wavelength
                point, for a total of NSTR*NAER values, where NAER is
                the number of wavelength points supplied.  The order of
                specification should be such that wavelength variation is
                most rapid.  For example, here is a case with 4 wavelengths
                and 6 streams:
  
                     nstr=6
                     wlbaer=.400,.500,.600,.700
                     wbaer =0.88,0.89,0.91,0.92
                     pmaer= 0.80,0.70,0.60,0.50,
                            0.64,0.49,0.36,0.25,
                            0.51,0.34,0.22,0.12,
                            0.41,0.24,0.13,0.06,
                            0.33,0.17,0.08,0.03,
                            0.26,0.12,0.05,0.02
 
  ABAER:        Wavelength (Angstrom model) exponent used to extrapolate 
                BLA extinction efficiency to wavelengths outside the 
                range of WLBAER [Qext ~ (lambda)^(-abaer)].  This parameter 
                is only operative when IAER=5.  (default=0) 

  IMOMA:       Controls phase function used for boundary layer aerosol
               The value of IMOMA is ignored when IAER=5 and PMAER is 
               specified.  Note that an asymmetry factor must be
               specified when IMOMA=3 (default=3).

  SPOWDER:     Setting SPOWDER to true causes an extra sub-surface layer
               extending between -1 and 0 km to be added to the bottom of 
               the atmospheric grid.  This layer may be used to model the
               effects of surface reflection and thermal emission caused
               by a granular surface material (e.g., snow or sand).  The 
               scattering properties of the surface layer may be specified 
               either with the cloud or aerosol inputs.  For example, a 
               thin water cloud over a snow surface composed of 100um 
               snow grains may be modeled with the following input file:

                &INPUT
                  sza=30,     idatm=4,   spowder=t
                  wlinf=.3,   wlsup=2,   iout=1
                  tcloud= 10000,  10
                  zcloud=    -1,   2
                  nre=     -100,  10
                /

               Similarly, the scattering properties of the surface and 
               atmosphere may be read from aerosol.dat with IAER=-1.
               To model a semi-infinite granular surface layer the optical
               depth of the bottom layer should be made very large, e.g., 
               10000, as indicated in the example. However, a smaller
               optical depth may also be specified in conjuntion with a
               given value of sub-surface albedo selected with ISALB.  
               Thus, in the previous example the effect of a thin snow
               layer covering a grass field may be modeled by setting,
               tcloud=100,10 and isalb=6

               NOTE: When SPOWDER is set, BTEMP no longer sets surface
               skin temperature.  Rather it sets the temperature of the
               sub-surface level below the granular material. At present 
               there is no way to set the surface temperature (above the
               graunual layer) to something other than the atmospheric 
               temperature of the bottom level.

               =============================================================

                

  NOTHRM:       nothrm=-1 => Thermal emission turned on only for wavelengths
                             greater than 2.0 um (default) 

                             (Note: During daylight hours solar
                             radiation is a factor of about 1.e5
                             greater than thermal radiation at 2.0um)

                nothrm=0  => Thermal emission turned on for all wavelengths

                nothrm=1  => No thermal emission

                NOTE: If thermal emission is desired, be sure that the
                      temperature steps in the atmospheric model are small
                      enough to resolve changes in the Planck function.  The
                      original version of the DISORT radiative transfer
                      module issued a warning message if the temperature
                      difference between successive levels in the atmosphere
                      exceeded 20 K.  All the standard atmospheres violate
                      this condition for at least 1 stratospheric layer.  
                      This warning message has been disabled to avoid 
                      clutter in SBDART's standard output. If near-IR thermal
                      emission from the stratosphere is important to your
                      application, you should supply SBDART with a new model 
                      atmosphere with higher resolution in the stratosphere.  
                      (see ZGRID1, ZGRID2, an NGRID)

     
  KDIST:        KDIST=-1 causes correlated-k optical depths and weighting
                factors to be read from files CKATM and CKTAU.  The format
                used to read these files is documented in subroutines
                gasinit and readk, both in file taugas.f.  

                If WLINF .eq. WLSUP all wavenumbers in the CKTAU file are 
                processed, otherwise only those wavenumbers in the range 
                10000./WLSUP to 10000./WLINF are used.

                NOTE: KDIST=-1 disables the effect of all input
                parameters that control aspects of the gaseous
                atmospheric profile.  Thus, KDIST=-1 disables input
                parameters WLINC, AMIX, SCLH2O, UW, UO3, O3TRP, ZTRP, 
                XN2, XO2, XCO2, XCH4, XN2O, XCO, XNO2, XSO2, XNH3, XNO,
                XHNO3, XO4, RHCLD, KRHCLR, NGRID, ZGRID1, ZGRID2,
                PBAR, and ZPRES.

                KDIST=0 causes the optical depth due to molecular
                absorption to be set to the negative log of the LOWTRAN
                transmission function.  This approximation is not
                appropriate for cases in which multiple scattering is
                important, but is not very wrong when the molecular
                absorption is weak or the scattering optical depth is
                small.

                KDIST=1 causes SBDART to use the LOWTRAN7
                k-distribution model of absorption by atmospheric
                gases.  Since a three term exponential fit is used,
                SBDART execution times are up to 3 times longer with
                KDIST > 0 compared to KDIST=0.

                KDIST=2 causes the k-fit transmissions to exactly
                match the LOWTRAN transmission along the solar beam
                direction.  This option may be useful when computing
                surface irradiance under clouds of optical thickness
                less than about 10.  This is because in this thin
                cloud case much of the radiation which reaches the
                surface propagates along the direct beam direction.

                KDIST=3 causes the k-fit transmissions to exactly
                match the LOWTRAN transmission along the solar beam
                direction for parts of the atmosphere above a scattering
                layer.  As the scattering optical depth increases above
                1 the k-fit factors are ramped back to there original
                LOWTRAN values.  The effect of the slant path correction
                is ramped down to zero for wavelengths greater than 4um,
                where solar energy input is less important.  KDIST=3 is 
                the default.  
               
  ZGRID1:       These three parameters can be used to change the grid
  ZGRID2:       resolution of the model atmosphere.  ZGRID1 controls
  NGRID:        the resolution near the bottom of the grid while
                ZGRID2 sets the maximum permissible step size (at the
                top of the grid).  NGRID sets the number of grid
                points.  For example ZGRID1=.5, ZGRID2=30, NGRID=45
                specifies a 45 element grid with a resolution of .5 km
                throughout the lower part of the grid and a largest step 
                of 30 km.
 
                The regridding is performed after the call to
                subroutine ATMS.  This allows regridding of the
                standard internal atmospheres as well as user
                specified atmospheres (read with IDATM=0).  No matter
                how many grid points were used to specify the original
                atmosphere, the new regridded atmosphere will contain
                NGRID vertical array elements.  The default value of
                ZGRID1 and ZGRID2 are set to 1 and 30km, respectively.
                The default value of NGRID=0, causes the initial un-modified
                atmsopheric model to be used.  The internal parameter, 
                MXLY, sets the maximum number of levels allowed.  Setting
                NGRID>MXLY causes NGRID to be set to MXLY.
                
                If NGRID is negative SBDART terminates execution
                after printing out the regridded values of Z,P,T,WH,WO
                to standard out.  This option can be used to preview the
                effect of a given set of ZGRID1,ZGRID2 and abs(NGRID)
                values.  Note that the regridded atmosphere listed with
                negative NGRID will contain the effects of non-default
                values of UW, UO3, O3TRP, PBAR, ZPRES, RHCLD, and KRHCLR

               The IDB print flag is used to select print diagnostics
               for a variety of computational parameters.  Setting 
               IDB(n)=m where m is any non-zero integer, will cause
               the diagnostics associated with array index n to be listed. 
               For some values of n, increasing the value of m (e.g., 
               IDB(8)=2) will produce more detailed diagnostics.  (default=0)

                    the first wavelength encountered. If idb(5)=2 the

                      solband is the toa solar irradiance in the band
                      gwt is k-distribution weight
                      dtauk is the k-distribution optical depth

                      
                    Note, to save time, the normal radiative transfer 
                    quantities are not computed when idb(7) is set.
                
             idb(8) surface brdf diagnostics for isalb=7,8,9 of -7,-8,-9
                    idb(8)=1: the surface brdf function is integrated 
                    over solid angle to obtain the surface albedo (albedo 
                    is essentially the ratio of botup/botdn with thermal 
                    emission turned off) for the given solar zenith angle. 
                    if isalb is positive (7,8,9) and idb(8)=2: the brdf 
                    function is output in the same format used to list 
                    the iout=20 radiance output.  The output slots 
                    ordinarily filled by botup are filled with the 
                    directional albedo, assuming incomming radiation is
                    parallel to the solar beam direction.


             idb(9) Optical depth due to Rayleigh, aerosols, cloud
                    molecular continuum and line, single scattering albedo
                    and asymmetry factor. Additional printouts for each
                    term in the k-fit are produced if KDIST=1.


                
  ZOUT:         2 element array specifying BOT and TOP altitude 
                points (km) for IOUT output.  For example ZOUT=0,50
                specifies output information for 0 and 50 km. The
                surface is always set at zero.  Note that the actual
                layers for which output is generated is determined by
                finding the atmospheric layers nearest the chosen
                value of ZOUT(1) and ZOUT(2).  (default = 0,100)

                This parameter can be used to determine the amount of 
                radiation absorbed in a particular atmospheric layer.
                For example, zout=2,3 tcloud=10 zcloud=2 iout=10 will
                produce flux output just below and above the cloud layer
                from which the cloud absorption may be computed as 
                topdn-topup-botdn+botup

                output quantities are,

                   WL    = wavelength                         (microns)

                   BOTDIR= direct downward flux at ZOUT(1) km (w/m2/micron)

                   NOTE: The filter function value, FFV, should be used
                         to perform integrations over wavelength intervals.
                         For example if WLINC is set positive (wavelength 
                         increment is constant), the total power (w/m2) at 
                         the surface in the interval from WLINF to WLSUP 
                         would be the sum

                NOTE: The radiance output from SBDART represents
                      scattered radiation. It does not include the
                      solar direct beam.  Also, keep in mind that UURS
                      represents the radiance at the user specified
                      sample directions.  Hence, computing the
                      irradiance by an angular integration of UURS
                      will not yield BOTDN because of the neglect of
                      the direct beam, and it will probably not yield
                      (BOTDN-BOTDIR) because of under-sampling.

==========================================================================



                       DISORT options
                       ==============
     
  DELTAM:      if set to true, use delta-m method (see Wiscombe, 1977).
               This method is essentially a delta-Eddington
               approximation applied to multiple radiation streams.
 
               In general, for a given number of streams, intensities
               and fluxes will be more accurate for phase functions
               with a large forward peak if 'DELTAM' is set
               TRUE. Intensities within 10 degrees or so of the
               forward scattering direction will often be less
               accurate, however, so when primary interest centers in
               this so-called 'aureole region', DELTAM should be set
               FALSE.(default=true)
     
  NSTR:        number of computational zenith angles used.  NSTR must
               be divisible by 2.  Using NSTR=4 reduces the time
               required for flux calculations by about a factor of 5
               compared to NSTR=16, with very little penalty in
               accuracy (about 0.5% difference when DELTAM is set
               true).  More streams should be used with radiance
               calculations.  The default of NSTR depends on the value
               of IOUT.  The default for flux computations (IOUT=1,7,10,11) 
               is NSTR=4. The default for radiance computations
               (IOUT=5,6,20,21,22,23) is NSTR=20.
               
  CORINT:      When set TRUE, intensities are correct for delta-M scaling 
               effects (see Nakajima and Tanaka, 1988). When FALSE,
               intensities are not corrected.  

               In general, CORINT should be set true when a beam
               source is present (FBEAM is not zero), DELTAM is TRUE,
               and the problem includes scattering.  However,
               CORINT=FALSE runs faster and produces fairly accurate
               intensities outside the aureole.  If CORINT=TRUE and
               phase function moments are specified with PMAER
               (IAER=5), or in aerosol.dat (IAER=-1), it is important
               to specify a sufficient number of phase function
               moments to adequately model single scattered radiation
               in the forward direction. Otherwise, if too few moments
               are provided, the intensities might actually be more
               accurate with CORINT=FALSE.

               Default value CORINT=.false.

               The input value of CORINT is ignored for:
               1) in irradiance mode, i.e., iout ne (5,6,20,21,22)
               2) there is no beam source (FBEAM=0.0), or
               3) there is no scattering (SSALB=0.0 for all layers) 

                      Radiance output
                      ===============
    

  NZEN:        Number of user zenith angles.  If this parameter is
               specified SBDART will output radiance values at NZEN
               zenith angles, evenly spaced between the first two
               values of input array UZEN.  For example, 

                nzen=9,
                uzen=0,80 

               will cause output at zenith angles 0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80.

  UZEN:        User zenith angles.  If NZEN is specified then UZEN is
               interpreted as the limits of the zenith angle range,
               and only the first two elements are required.  If NZEN
               is not specified then up to NSTR values of UZEN may be
               specified.  If neither NZEN nor UZEN is specified and 
               a radiance calculation is requested
               (IOUT=5,6,20,21,22,23) a default set of zenith angles 
               is used, which depends on the value IOUT as follows:
                     * IOUT=5 or 20:  NZEN=18, UZEN=0,85
                     * IOUT=6 or 21:  NZEN=18, UZEN=95,180
                     * IOUT=22 or 23: NZEN=18, UZEN=0,180

               NOTE: UZEN specifies the zenith angle of at which the
               radiation is propagating:

               UZEN = 0    => radiation propagates directly up
               UZEN < 90   => radiation in upper hemisphere
               UZEN > 90   => radiation in lower hemisphere
               UZEN = 180  => radiation propagates directly down
     
  VZEN:        user nadir angles.  This is just an alternate way to 
               specify the direction of user radiance angles, whereby
               uzen=180-vzen

  NPHI:        Number of user azimuth angles.  If this parameter is
               specified SBDART will output radiance values at NPHI
               azimuth angles, evenly spaced between the first two
               values of input array PHI.  For example, nphi=7,
               phi=0,180 will cause output at zenith angles
               0,30,60,90,120,150,180

  PHI:         User relative azimuth angles.  If NPHI is specified then 
               PHI is interpreted as the limits of the azimuth angle range,
               and only the first two elements are required.  If NPHI
               is not specified then up to NSTR values of PHI may be
               specified.  If neither NPHI nor PHI is specified and a
               radiance calculation is requested (IOUT=5,6,20,21,22,23)
               a default set of azimuth angles is used, equivalent to
               the case NPHI=19, PHI=0,180.              

               NOTE: If SAZA is set, then PHI=0 represents radiation 
               propagating in the Northern direction.  PHI increases 
               clockwise looking down on the Earth's surface. 
               If SAZA is not set, then PHI is the relative azimuth 
               angle from the forward scattering direction. 

               * PHI < 90   => forward scattered radiation
               * PHI > 90   => backward scattered radiation

               For example, if the sun is setting in the West,
               radiation propagating to the South-East has a relative
               azimuth of 45 degrees.
               
               NOTE: SBDART is currently configured to model radiation
                     with at most 40 computational zenith angles and
                     40 azimuthal modes.  While these limits may be
                     expanded, be aware that running SBDART with a
                     much larger number will significantly increase
                     running time and memory requirements.  In tests
                     performed on a DEC Alpha, the execution time
                     scaled roughly with NSTR^2, for NSTR less than
                     40.  The code's memory usage also scales roughly
                     as NSTR^2.
          
               NOTE: The default value of the solar azimuth angle, SAZA=180.
                     This value of SAZA will cause forward scattered solar 
                     radiation to appear near PHI=0.



                    radiation boundary conditions
                    =============================
 
 IBCND:
       = 0 : general case: boundary conditions any combination of:
              * beam illumination from the top      ( see FBEAM)
              * isotropic illumination from the top ( see FISOT)
              * thermal emission from the top       ( see TEMIS,TTEMP)
              * internal thermal emission sources   ( see TEMPER)
              * reflection at the bottom            ( see LAMBER,ALBEDO,HL)
              * thermal emission from the bottom    ( see BTEMP)
       = 1 : isotropic illumination from top and bottom, in order to get
             ALBEDO and transmissivity of the entire medium vs. incident
             beam angle; 
             The only input variables considered in this case are 
             NLYR,DTAUC,SSALB,PMOM,NSTR,USRANG,NUMU,UMU,ALBEDO,DELTAM, 
             PRNT,HEADER, and the array dimensions.  
             NOPLNK,LAMBER are assumed TRUE, the bottom boundary can have 
             any ALBEDO.  the sole output is ALBMED,TRNMED.  UMU is
             interpreted as the array of beam angles in this case.
             If USRANG = TRUE they must be positive and in increasing 
             order, and will be returned this way; internally, however, the
             negatives of the UMU's are added, so MAXUMU must be at least
             2*NUMU. 
             If USRANG = FALSE, UMU is returned as the NSTR/2 positive 
             quadrature angle cosines, in increasing order.

 FISOT:     intensity of top-boundary isotropic illumination.  (units
            w/sq m if thermal sources active, otherwise arbitrary
            units).  corresponding incident flux is pi (3.14159...)
            times 'FISOT'.

 TEMIS:     emissivity of top layer, not used if NOTHRM=1

 BTEMP:     Surface (skin) temperature in Kelvin.  If not set, the 
            surface temperature is set to the temperature of the
            bottom layer of the model atmosphere.  The surface
            emissivity is calculated from the albedo (see ISALB and
            ALBCON).  The input value of BTEMP is ignored when 
            NOTHRM=1.  When SPOWDER=.true. BTEMP specifies the skin
            temperature of the level just below the granular layer.



          DISORT specific output options:
          ===================================
PRNT(k):   k
           1        input variables (except PMOM)
           2        fluxes
           3        intensities at user levels and angles
           4        planar transmissivity and planar albedo
                    as a function solar zenith angle ( IBCND = 1 )
           5        phase function moments PMOM for each layer
                    ( only if PRNT(1) = TRUE, and only for layers
                    with scattering )
